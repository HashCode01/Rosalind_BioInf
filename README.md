# ROSALIND 
## IMPLEMENTING GENETIC ALGORITHMS

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

Given below is the list of problems, I have already solved. 
I will be adding more and more problems as and when I am done with those. 

### The main aim here is to help the genetic community in the learning process by providing fast and efficient solutions to all the problems on the Rosalind website to foster better learning. 

Anyone with faster and efficient solutions to these problems is welcome to create a pull request and we can together work on these solutions. 

The problem statements can be accessed [here](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/).
